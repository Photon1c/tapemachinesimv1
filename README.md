# 🎛️ Tape Machine Sim Version 1 🎚️

This project is live [here](https://cheddarbutler.com/threejs/tapemachinev1/)

![tapemachine](media/tapemachinev1.PNG)

A realistic 3D simulation of a classic seismograph/tape machine, built with Three.js. This interactive web application brings to life the intricate mechanics of a vintage recording device, complete with a moving needle and paper tape system.

## 🌟 Features

- 🎥 Realistic 3D visualization of a classic tape machine
- 🪡 Interactive needle movement simulation
- 📜 Dynamic paper tape system
- 🎮 Camera controls for detailed inspection
- 🎨 High-quality 3D models and textures
- 📱 Responsive design for various screen sizes

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
